# Hi-Low

This is the number guessing game high-low.
The computer chooses a number at random and you must guess what it is.
If your guess is correct, you win.
If it is wrong, the computer tells you whether it was high or low.
If you fail to guess it within a certain number of attempts, you lose.

Run it like so:

```shell
hi-low --guesses 5 --min 1 --max 100
```
