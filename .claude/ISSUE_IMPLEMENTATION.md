# Issue Implementation
- Read the README.md file first to get an overview of the project.
- Update the GitHub project status to "In Progress" when you start working on the issue.
- Only create the functionality specified in the issue.
- Always write unit tests to exercise whatever new functionality you just created.
- Strive for 100% code coverage. (You may have to skip tricky error conditions.)
- Check in intermediate work that makes a large change.
- If the github issue description contains checkboxes, check them off as you complete tasks.
- When you think the issue is complete, run all tests.
- If any test fails, keep working on the issue until all tests pass. "Iterate until green."
- Once the issue is complete and all tests are passing, submit a pull request.
- Update the GitHub project status to "Done" when the pull request is created.
